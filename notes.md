- default datamodel?
- example guards/actions specifically for test?
- helpers/builder API for better UX?
- perf testing on critical paths
- go back through and implement
  - guard, action, event, parallel state tests using test shims where necessary (make test guards and actions, make test events, do use the hierarchy to handle parallel states)
